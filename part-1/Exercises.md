### Lab5 part-1: Exercises

Complete the following exercises by providing the appropriate SQL scripts. You can use the Google Cloud SQL server to complete this task.

1. First, you must set up your command line to the current project id.

* Type the following command and press enter. Make sure you replace the `<PROJECT_ID>` with your project id, as presented in the previous video.

```shell
$ gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID>
```

>  Enter a password when prompted.
>  :rotating_light: Do not expect to see any characters on the screen! 

* Then, run the next command to connect to the SQL terminal.

```shell
$ gcloud sql connect <DATABASE_NAME> --user=<USER_NAME>
```

3. You are now connected to the SQL terminal, your terminal should look like this.

```shell
$ mysql>
```

3. Use SQL to create the following commands, and review the existing material.
4. Provide an SQL script to list all the available databases.

```sql
?
```

5. Create a new database called `lab1_exercise_db`.

```sql
?
```

6. Select the `lab1_exercise_db` database as the current database to work.

```sql
?
```

7. Create a new table called `planets`, following the next data and specifications.

   a. The table data includes the next:

| planet_id | planet_name | planet_terrain | planet_size |
| --------- | ----------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| A1        | Tatooine    | Desert         | 10465       |
| A2        | Coruscant   | Urban  area    | 6100        |

â€‹	b. The table specification is as follows:

* `planet_id` is based on characters, and it is a primary key. This field will accept a maximum of 30 characters per input.
* `planet_name` is based on characters. This field will accept a maximum of 30 characters per input.
* `planet_terrain` is based on characters. This field will accept a maximum of 30 characters per input.
* `planet_size` is integer based.

8. Provide the SQL script to create the table.

```sql
?
```

9. Run a command to show the available tables.

```
?
```

10. Provide an SQL script to insert all the data into the `planets` table.

```sql
?
```

11. Provide an SQL script to extract all the data and print it.

```mysql
?
```

12. Provide an SQL script to insert the following data.

| planet_id | planet_name  | planet_terrain | planet_size |
| --------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| A3        | Death  Start | Urban  area    | 120         |

```mysql
?
```

13. Run the previous insert command once more. Does it fail, and why?

```mysql
?
```

13. Provide an SQL script to **extract all the data** and print it.

```mysql
?
```

14. Provide an SQL script to **extract all the planets** that have a size **greater than 5000** km.

```mysql
?
```

15. Provide an SQL script to extract the planet names that have a **desert** terrain.

```mysql
?
```

16. Provide an SQL script to **update** the size of the **Coruscant** planet to **6120**.

```mysql
?
```

17. Provide an SQL script to add a new column called `planet_population`. The new column should include **integers of up to 20 digits** in size.

```mysql
?
```

18. Provide an SQL script to **update Tatooine's population to 200000**.

```mysql
?
```

19. Provide an SQL script to **delete the planet** `Death Star` from the table.

```mysql
?
```

20. Provide an SQL script to extract all the **planet names, terrains and sizes** for those **planets that start with the letter** `T`.

```mysql
?
```
